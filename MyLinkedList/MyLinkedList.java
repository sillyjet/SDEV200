I do not understand what this assignment is asking me to do. I see that it is requiring me to create a new class called TwoWayLinkedList that implements the interface
called MyList, however this interface doesn't exist within the code in Listing 24.5, and although I found the interface within the test code for assignment 24.1. this
doesn't change the fact that all the methods I am supposedly supposed to implement from MyLinkedList are empty because they are supposed to be completed in separate
assignments. I am not sure what I am missing. My family wasn't even able to decipher the instructions.

Side note: I love that E is used as a generic object. It's a good letter.
